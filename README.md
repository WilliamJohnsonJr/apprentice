# Apprentice

## An app built by someone who thinks Standard Code is cool.

## Live at: <https://apprenticesc-wjohnson.herokuapp.com/>

## Purpose
This app was built during an interactive code challenge as an application for an Apprentice job opening at Standard Code. This was the first time I had ever used Ruby or Ruby on Rails (I was trained as a Front-End JavaScript developer), so I taught myself the basics of Ruby on Rails in three days by reading documentation and various online articles on Rails.

The application process also involved translating binary into text, which I did via the Ruby program that I wrote here: [Binary-To-Text App Repo] (https://github.com/WilliamJohnsonJr/binarytotext)

## Tools Used:
Ruby on Rails, Ruby, Semantic HTML, SCSS/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Responsive Design
